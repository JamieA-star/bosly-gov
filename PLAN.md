BOSLY GOV — PLAN
Last updated: 15 September 2026

================================================================
WHAT BOSLY GOV IS
================================================================

Bosly Gov is the custodian of the integrity of two production apps:
Bosly Accord and Bosly Keep. It exists so the founder can spend 30–60
minutes a day on maintenance rather than hours hunting for bugs.

Its job is to:

- Verify the constitution is being kept (encryption, privacy, ethical
  exclusion, crypto posture)
- Catch silent failures before users do
- Hold the whole picture
- Report only when something is wrong
- Document everything it does
- Evolve with the system
- Reduce its reliance on external LLMs over time

================================================================
THE TRUST CONTRACT
================================================================

Bosly Gov's relationship with the founder is governed by a trust
contract. This is not a feature. It is the rule that shapes every
other rule.

1. Nothing changes without explicit consent. Gov may investigate,
   propose, and explain freely. Gov may not modify files, run
   migrations, restart services, delete data, or change configuration
   without explicit approval of that specific action.

2. Consent is per-action, not per-session.

3. Gov teaches while it works.

4. Gov reports its own behaviour, including uncertainty.

5. Gov cannot evolve itself without consent.

6. Everything is logged and reversible.

7. Uncertainty means stop and ask, never guess.

8. Gov is honest about what it can't do.

Trust is learned, not assumed. Gov earns it incrementally. The
founder's trust grows as demonstrations accumulate.

================================================================
THE PROBLEM BEING SOLVED
================================================================

Twelve-plus silent bugs have been found across both apps in the last
ten days. The code looked like it worked and didn't. Examples:

- GBp currency conversion valued UK stocks 100x too high
- Ethical score-drop sell path never fired
- navigator.serviceWorker.ready hung forever without a registered worker
- Client/server payload shape mismatch returned silent 400s
- Dead UI code with state and handlers but no JSX
- NEXT_PUBLIC_* referenced in client code but never in the build bundle

Manual testing doesn't scale. Both apps are too big for one person to
hold in their head.

================================================================
THE ARCHITECTURE
================================================================

Three layers:

1. Project-local invariant tests. Small, fast, deterministic. Live in
   each repo. Catch the bug classes that have actually happened.

2. Central orchestration in Gov. Schedules, runs, aggregates, reports,
   alerts. Does not duplicate tests.

3. Constitution checks. The highest-value promise checks: encryption,
   privacy, ethical exclusion, crypto posture, quantum readiness,
   consent gating.

================================================================
WHAT EXISTS TODAY (15 SEPTEMBER 2026)
================================================================

Bosly Keep:
- scripts/diagnostics/verify-*.ts — 6 scripts, ~44 tests
- scripts/run-tests.sh — runner, runs typecheck then verify scripts
- npm test gated into deploy:keep
- This is the reference implementation.

Bosly Accord:
- NO invariant tests exist.
- scripts/accord-test.ts — training/scenario simulator, NOT a test
  runner. Runs 50 iterations, generates test data, calls LLMs.
- scripts/e2e-full-test.ts — E2E suite, runs at 4am daily.

Bosly Gov:
- Command routing (health, diagnose, audit, evolve)
- Memory files per project
- Context orchestration
- NO dedicated check runner.

Cron jobs already running:
- sync-email every 10 minutes
- backup daily at 3:00am
- monitor daily at 3:15am
- e2e-full-test daily at 4:00am

Existing tooling on the server:
- /usr/local/bin/bosly-audit — 1000-line bash script, 15+ sections
  of infrastructure checks. Takes ~10 minutes. Not scheduled.
- /usr/local/bin/bosly-monitor — daily monitoring script.
- /usr/local/bin/bosly-diagnose-v5.py, bosly-health, bosly-evolve,
  and others — manual-only.

================================================================
PHASE 1 — BUILD THE PIPELINE
================================================================

Goal: prove the pipeline works end to end with one invariant check.
Then add more.

[x] Step 1 — Create bosly-1.0/tests/invariants/ (flat, no
    subdirectories).

[x] Step 2 — Write env-public-vars.ts. Scan client code for
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_* references, compare against
    .env.production and .env.example, fail if any referenced
    variable is missing from either.

[ ] Step 3 — Write bosly-1.0/scripts/test-fast.ts. Find all
    tests/invariants/*.ts, run via npx tsx, aggregate results,
    exit non-zero on fail.

[ ] Step 4 — Create bosly-gov-v4/manifests/checks.yml. One file
    listing both projects' fast-tier checks. Accord calls
    test-fast.ts, Keep calls run-tests.sh.

[ ] Step 5 — Create bosly-gov-v4/runners/run_checks.py. Reads the
    manifest, runs each check, writes JSON reports to
    /mnt/bosly/bosly-data/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/, prints a summary.

[ ] Step 6 — Test all of it manually. Prove the pipeline works.

[ ] Step 7 — Add one cron entry: nightly at 5:00am.

[ ] Step 8 — Add email-on-failure. Gov reads SMTP creds from
    .env.production, sends via Python's smtplib.

================================================================
WHAT COMES AFTER PHASE 1
================================================================

Phase 2 — Add more invariant checks. One per bug class:
- currency conversion
- ethical score drop
- service worker registration
- payload shape
- dead UI code
Each maps to a bug that has actually happened.

Phase 3 — Constitution checks. Encryption actually encrypts. Privacy
actually holds. Ethical exclusions actually enforced. These trace to
Trust document commitments.

Phase 4 — Drift checks. Crypto posture, dependency age, post-quantum
readiness. Slower cadence, weekly or monthly.

Phase 5 — LLM reduction. Track the ratio of memory-first to
LLM-fallback decisions. Trend it downward over time. Eventually run
core reasoning without external models.

================================================================
WHAT NOT TO DO
================================================================

- Don't build a general-purpose testing framework. Keep it small.
- Don't make every check cross-repo. Project-local first.
- Don't start with expensive browser suites. Small deterministic
  tests first.
- Don't build dashboards before reports are solid.
- Don't invent a policy DSL. Manifests and plain scripts are enough.
- Don't make alerting noisy. Report only failures.

================================================================
CURRENT STATUS
================================================================

Phase 1, Step 2 complete. env-public-vars.ts runs, passes, and
found two real issues on its first run. Committed as 2b51a16.

Next action: Step 3 — write scripts/test-fast.ts (the runner that
invokes all tests/invariants/*.ts and aggregates results).

Next action: create tests/invariants/ and write env-public-vars.ts.

When a step is done, tick the box and update this section.
